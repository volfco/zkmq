rust zookeeper backed message queue. designed for low throughput, high durability, message queue using only zookeeper. 
messages also support filtering. the producer can set filters, and the client can chose to respect the filters.

**note: this is still experimental and in development. don't assume anything will work or that the api will remain the same**
